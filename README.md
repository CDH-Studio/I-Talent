# What is I-Talent?

I-Talent is an internal web-application that would enable employees to share information about their employment status, job position, skills, and credentials.

Any ISED employee will be able to login to I-Talent with their windows credentials, where they can create a profile or search for employees with the right expertise, education, competencies, experience and other essential qualifications at any time for talent management, staffing, succession planning, or simply for insight on a project or file.

# Tech Stack

- Frontend Service Framework: React

# Architecture Overview

I-Talent is broken down into two different services: Frontend and Backend.

- Frontend: Serves the React app that is the web interface for I-Talent.
- Backend: Manages data coming into and out of the database (see its [README](services/backend/README.md))

# Local Development

The following is a guide on how to bring up the pieces of the application for development.

## Web App Development Prerequisites

You must have the following already installed:

- Docker
- Vscode

#### Linter

The following extensions need to be installed for the linter:

- Prettier (plugin)
- Eslint (plugin)

Eslint is used for the project with Airbnb style guide.

[React Airbnb style guide documentation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
[Javascript Airbnb style guide documentation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Running the Entire Application

To run the entire application locally, run the following:

```
docker-compose up
```

You can access different components of the web application:

- Frontend at `localhost:3000`.
- Backend at `localhost:8080`.
- API documentation at `localhost:8080/api-docs`.
- Postgres database at `localhost:5432`.
- Prisma studio at `localhost:5555`.
- Keycloak at `localhost:8180`.

Checkout the `docker-compose.yml` file for information on which ports to use to access all of the other services.
