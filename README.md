An improved directory and employee search tool.

I-Talent is an internal web-application that would enable employees to share information about their employment status, job position, skills, and credentials. ISED employees can login to I-Talent with their windows credentials, where they can create a profile or search for employees with the right expertise, education, competencies, experience and other essential qualifications at any time for talent management, staffing, succession planning, or simply for insight on a project or file.

# Getting started

You'll need to create three files to define the envirnment variables, one at the root of the project and two in the `env` folder. To get those variables, ask the current developers. 

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are technically optional tools for development, but are highly recommended! A list of useful Visual Studio Code extensions are listed [here](https://github.com/CDH-Studio/I-Talent/wiki/Tech-stack#useful-visual-studio-code-extensions).

In the root of the project, to start developing the application use the [Docker Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) or run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can now access different components of the web application:

- [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Application
- [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) - Prisma studio, database visualizer/editer
- [localhost:3031](http://localhost:3031) - Webpack analyzer (need to run `yarn analyze` in the frontend docker container)
- [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - API endpoints
- [localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs) - API endpoints documentation
- [localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432) - PostgreSQL database

> Note: Internet connection is required to run the application unless you setup keycloak locally with the steps described in the [wiki](https://github.com/CDH-Studio/I-Talent/wiki/Local-Keycloak-setup)

Visit backend [README](services/backend/README.md) and the frontend [README](services/frontend/README.md) for more information.
