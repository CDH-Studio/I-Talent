# What is I-Talent?

I-Talent is an internal web-application that would enable employees to share information about their employment status, job position, skills, and credentials.

Any ISED employee will be able to login to I-Talent with their windows credentials, where they can create a profile or search for employees with the right expertise, education, competencies, experience and other essential qualifications at any time for talent management, staffing, succession planning, or simply for insight on a project or file.

# Tech Stack

- Frontend Service Framework: React
- Backend Service Framework: Node + Express + Prisma
- Database: Postgres
- Testing Framework: Jest
- Hosting: OpenShift

# Architecture Overview

I-Talent is broken down into two different services: Frontend and Backend.

- Frontend: Serves the React app that is the web interface for I-Talent.
- Backend: Manages data coming into and out of the database (see its [README](services/backend/README.md))

# Local Development

The following is a guide on how to bring up the pieces of the application for development.

## Web App Development Prerequisites

You must have the following already installed:

- Docker
- Vscode

#### Linter

The following extensions need to be installed for the linter:

- Prettier (plugin)
- Eslint (plugin)

Eslint is used for the project with Airbnb style guide.

[React Airbnb style guide documentation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
[Javascript Airbnb style guide documentation](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Running the Entire Application

To run the entire application locally, run the following:

```
docker-compose up
```

You can access different components of the web application:

- Frontend at `localhost:3000`.
- Backend at `localhost:8080`.
- API documentation at `localhost:8080/api-docs`.
- Postgres database at `localhost:5432`.
- Prisma studio at `localhost:5555`.
- Webpack analyzer `localhost:3031` (see frontend README to see detailed instructions to run).

Checkout the `docker-compose.yml` file for information on which ports to use to access all of the other services.

## To run keycloak locally

1. Add the network_mode to the backend container to "host" (in docker-compose.yml)
2. And add the following docker-compose service

```yml
keycloak:
  container_name: "upskill-keycloak"
  image: "jboss/keycloak"
  ports:
    - "8180:8180"
  volumes:
    - ./keycloak:/opt/jboss/keycloak/keycloak
  hostname: keycloak
  command:
    - "-Dkeycloak.import=/opt/jboss/keycloak/keycloak/realm-export.json -Djboss.http.port=8180"
  environment:
    KEYCLOAK_USER: administrator
    KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: password
```

3. You'll need to make everything linking a container in the backend to refer localhost instead (i.e. redis and postgres)
4. You'll also need to update the keycloak environment variables in the frontend and in the backend to refer to http://localhost:8180/auth

The credentials for the users when using the local keycloak are specified in the [realm-export.json](./keycloak/realm-export.json) file
